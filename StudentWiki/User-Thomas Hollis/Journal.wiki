This section outlines the work done on all the courses that have to do with course preparation. 

== 0.1 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Wiki_editing Wiki Editing] ==
; Objective
The main objective is to gain an in depth understanding of how to navigate and edit the student wiki as well as comprehend what will be expected of me throughout the course. 

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 2 h; taken: 6 h; date started: 2018-09-14; date completed: 2018-09-15
</div>

; Activities
I accessed and created my main StudentWiki user page, journal page and insights page.  This was not too challenging as I have been contributing to Wikipedia's public body of information for a few years now and I am used to the WikiMarkup syntax. As an avid fan of the open-source community, I also created and committed my current progress to my own personal [https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta "Bioinformatics" Github repository] for the rest of the world to use. What was the most time consuming was to explore the entire wiki to see everything that this course has to offer, including all the activities that occurred in previous years. I must confess I did get a little carried away in my exploration and the boundary between "fun" and "work" is already starting to blur. However, I do believe that this is a good sign and I am very excited for the course ahead.

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Journal Journal Writing].

== 0.2 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Journal Journal Writing] ==
; Objective
The main objective is to start off my Journal with a strong baseline on which I can build the rest of my discoveries in this course.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 1.5 h; date started: 2018-09-15; date completed: 2018-09-15
</div>

; Activities
I started writing my journal, including this precise section. I also edited my main [[User:Thomas_Hollis | user page]] and added some information to help my classmates identify who I am and what my background is. This will undoubtably be useful for collaboration in the future, especially given my computer science background with very little biology knowledge. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/ABC-Plagiarism Plagiarism].

== 0.3 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/ABC-Plagiarism Plagiarism] ==
; Objective
The main objective is to revise concepts related to Plagiarism. Collaboration can all to easily turn into plagiarism in academic institutions and the only way to stamp it out is through education.

Read the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Netiquette Netiquette] page carefully and came up with an insight for future me.

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Backups Backups].

== 0.6 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Backups Backups] ==
; Objective
The main objective is to refresh existing knowledge on how to securely backup data to prevent accidental data loss. 
<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 0.5 h; date started: 2018-09-16; date completed: 2018-09-16
</div>

; Activities
Read the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Backups Backups] page carefully and verified the effectiveness of my current backup solution. I currently store all of my personal files (excluding application data) in iCloud drive, which is continually backed up on Apple servers. So when is the last time I made a backup? Approximately three seconds ago when I saved my most recent file. Apple servers themselves are geographically distributed, redundant and backed up (often using RAID or similar technology). In addition, as I do not trust anyone else but myself with my own data, I also make differential local backups of my entire drive on the 1st of each month. This is done on two separate external hard drives (Time Machine really is a good utility). This allows me to have an on-site backup and off-site backup which protects me in the case that there is a fire and both my laptop and my hard drive get destroyed. Indeed the risk of this is non-negligeable as there are 24 000 house fires per year in Canada <ref>SGI Canada. (2018). Fire prevention and safety. Retrieved September 16, 2018, from https://www.sgicanada.ca/news?title=fire-prevention-and-safety</ref> for a total of 14 million houses <ref>Statistics Canada. (2016). Canada 2016 Census. Retrieved September 16, 2018, from https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/98-200-x/2016005/98-200-x2016005-eng.cfm</ref>. The probability of fire is therefore around 0.17% per year, roughly the same as the SSD failure rate listed in the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Backups Backups] page. 

As a quick sanity check I created and deleted a test file (containing the data: "ATGC") that I successfully recovered, as shown aside. [[File:RecoveredFile.png|200px|thumb|right|Recovered data from deleted test file]]

; Conclusion and Outlook
While friends may laugh at my backup strategy and fail to understand why I get so excited on the first day of each month, I will persist in backing up my data reliably. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Cargo_Cult Cargo Cult].

== 0.7 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Cargo_Cult Cargo Cult] ==

; Activities
After reading the entire recommended setup, I made a total of 0 changes to my setup. Indeed, I already had installed all the recommended tools, already structured my filesystem well and of course all my file extensions are always displayed by default. Yay! 

I very much like that Prof. Steipe is on my side in the macOS vs. Windows war... take that [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates Bill]. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Installation Installation].

= 1. R Programming =
This section outlines the work done on all the courses related to learning the R programming language. 

== 1.1 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Installation Installation] ==
; Objective
The main objectives are to remind myself on how to install and run packages in R. 

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 0.5 h; date started: 2018-09-16; date completed: 2018-09-16
</div>

; Activities
Indeed as I have had prior experience using R and RStudio this module was more of a refresher. Nonetheless, I found it to be a useful review - especially the script that checks if a package is already installed before installing it. I also executed all the code suggested and had a good play around with the new packages discussed. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Setup Setup].

== 1.2 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Setup Setup] ==
; Objective
The main objectives are to check that my R environment is setup as recommended for bioinformatics.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-09-16; date completed: 2018-09-16
</div>

; Activities
Indeed as I have used RStudio in the past only for machine learning and statistics, it was not optimally configured for Bioinformatics so I slightly tweaked my setup. I also learnt all about connecting RStudio to GitHub and did all the suggested exercises.

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Console Console].

== 1.3 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Console Console] ==

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Help Help].

== 1.4 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Help Help] ==

</div>

; Activities
Running all the suggested code was a good opportunity for me to check that I am building my knowledge on good foundations. I was also able to make sure I don't have any bad R-programming habits to shake off. One particular thing I brushed up on was the difference between the "<-" and "=" in R. A really good explanation was read [https://renkun.me/2014/01/28/difference-between-assignment-operators-in-r/ here]. I also found out in this week's lecture that you never need to explicitly define parameters that have the "=" sign in R documentation.

I ran through the code and spend a significant amount of time getting lost in rabbit wholes about how R ''actually'' does things... (see more on this in my [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/students/index.php/User:Thomas_Hollis/insights!#Insight_.236_-_Why_you_should_never_trust_someone_who_says_.22Trust_Me.22 insights!] page).

; Activities
This unit was actually very interesting as it went over in detail an aspect of R that I had always overlooked: the detail of lists. I learn lots of new R tricks! 
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
Here is the script I wrote:

== 1.9 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Subsetting Subsetting] ==
; Objective
The main goal for me here is to learn the details of subsetting in R which I may not already be aware of.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 2 h; date started: 2018-09-19; date completed: 2018-09-19
</div>

; Activities
I was surprised to learn a lot of new things about subsetting when completing all the required exercises.  For example, it was interesting to find out the difference between <code>order(x)</code> and <code>sort.list(x)</code> simply by reading R documentation! I absolutely love how organised the R documentation is - makes coding in R extremely smooth! Lots of new things covered here. I must make sure to try to practice what I have learnt soon to help engrain it into long term memory.

Since I had totally not seen this I was a bit confused as I guessed my sketch out of the blue. One humiliating lecture painfully revealed how much I have missed. This was however a surprisingly a great learning opportunity to ensure I am more careful in the future. I redid this unit and wrote an amended version of my initial abomination:

</div>

; Activities
I will take the in class quiz for this learning unit (yay, I got 100%)! I also attended a quiz before on the NCBI and EBI, just to get a feeling of how they are. 

I read through the notes on graphs and networks and went through the R script tutorial, which I particularly enjoyed. I also had a gander at the [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21527005 pubmed paper] on analysing biological networks using graph theory. A very interesting read even if some of the details went over my head.

* The 8 main categories of graphs covered (in lectures and in my external readings) were: DAGs (directed acyclic graphs), cyclic graphs (like DAGs but with infinite response), trees (top to bottom direction only graph), random graphs, hypergraphs (with sets), dual graphs (a.k.a Voronoi diagrams), De Bruijn graphs (with amino acid sequences), Euler cycles (each edge visited once), Hamilton Cycles (each node visited exactly once).

* The 5 main types of graph set metrics covered were: node number (size), edge number (in-degree, out-degree or simply degree), histogram of degrees, topology (degree centrality leads to high degree nodes in centre of network), state (random, scale-free i.e. no meaningful average node or hierarchical).

* The 5 main topologic metrics covered are: shortest path, centrality, diameter, spanning trees (all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges - cannot be disconnected), causality (cannot have time delay units violating principles of causality) 

* The 4 main methods for automatic graph generation were: Erdos-Renyi (random connection), Gilbert, Barabasi-Albert (degree drop as node number increases), Price.

* The 4 main techniques for achieving scale-free graphs were: Erdos-Renyi (as before), copy model (add new nodes by copying a fraction of links of existing nodes), hierarchal model, hyperbolic geometric graphs (nodes connected if distance between them is smaller than a hyperbolic threshold)

* The 2 main algorithms for structure analysis covered were: Dijkstra's algorithm (find shortest path in O(<math>V^2</math>)), Floyd-Warshall algorithm (all the shortest paths in O(<math>V^3</math>))

The main equations to remember here are:

* Scale free state probability (where <math>k</math> is usually between 2 and 3): 

<math>P(k) \propto k^{-\gamma}</math> (blimey, wiki renders LaTeX poorly...)

* Betweenness centrality: 

<math>C_b(w) = \sum_{i\neq j\neq w} \frac{\sigma_{ij}(w)}{\sigma_{ij}}</math> 

; Conclusion and Outlook

Graph theory is so awesome. I was familiar with Dijkstra before (a personal hero of mine) but I had no idea about many metrics discovered today. A true gem of information. I can see how these graphs could be leveraged frequently in bioinformatics!

Thankfully I read a lot of the supplementary materials including much of the wikipedia content. I think without this, the coding exercise would have been very confusing. I find all this stuff so cool. My world of computer science crashing into my genome, it's a beautiful sight. 

I was surprised to find a lot of M codons (start codons) and did some digging as to why this is the case. In fact I found on [https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/46427/multiple-start-and-stop-codons-in-mrna-and-pre-mrna the Biology StackExchange] that in about 5% of genes the first AUG (start codon) is skipped and translation starts at one of the other AUG sequences (although this is still poorly understood).

Read through the learning unit and ran the R code. My species is "Babjeviella inositovora" and it's BiCode is "BABIN". This is awesome, I love it! I even created a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babjeviella_inositovora Wikipedia page] for it! Why does El Salvador have a page for it and not the english wiki? According to its [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=Babjeviella+inositovora NCBI page], my species has potential applications in biotechnology.

Update: due to an issue in the BABIN genome sequence being incomplete, Prof. Steipe has asked me to abandon it and pick a new one (by incrementing my student number by 1). This was quite sad as I was starting to get attached to BABIN. Oh well, my new species is "Isaria fumosorosea" and it's BiCode is "ISAFU". It already has a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaria_fumosorosea Wikipedia page] and I look forward to adopting it.

[[File:TomGeneticCodeOptimality.png]]

Interpretation: Both modified alternative genetic codes yielded distributions with significantly more mutations (based on mutation frequency & penalty as defined in the code). Interestingly, the variance of these mutation distributions was also wider for the modified genetic codes (in blue and purple) than for the original (in yellow). This suggests that the original genetic code is particularly good at resisting the impact of mutations. Indeed, even after some changes, these mutations will not necessarily be as expressed in the original genetic code than it would be in the alternative genetic codes. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
The genetic code is remarkably mutation proof. This is because the impact of the mutations (once translated back) on average causes less penalty (tangible impact) than in randomly generated variations of the genetic code. This would be in line with my expectations as I would expect natural selection to leave room for some mutation but not an excessive and unmanageable amount (with my limited knowledge of biology though, I am not making this statement with much confidence or authority...).

My first learning unit to be submitted for credit! I intend on spending a lot of time on this to make sure I get it right. I created the evaluation submission page at: [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/students/index.php/User:Thomas_Hollis/Eval_Storing_Data User:Thomas_Hollis/Eval_Storing_Data]. 

The data formats covered are: '''FASTA''' (simple, commonly used), '''GBFF''' (extensively annotatable), '''BLAST''' (output file parsers heavily worked on for many years), '''PDB''' (apparently impossible to read all information from all PDB files with a single parser).

The data grammars covered are: '''ASN.1''' (abstract syntax notation v1 - used by the NCBI), '''XML''' (extended markup language - widely used online), '''JSON''' (Java Script Object Notation - popular for key:value pairs, more human readable than XML). 

The data model implementations covered are: '''text files in filesystems''' (using for example a folder hierarchy containing JSON files), '''spreadsheets''' (do not scale well, convert to .csv files for R imports), '''R lists and dataframes''' (what will be used mostly in this course), '''relational databases''' (such as MySQL, Maria DB, or Postgres).

I also went through all the R code thoroughly with some extra background reading to make sure everything is in tip top shape. I had to change MYSPE as BABIN had missing information.

; Activities
This unit was tough. There is a lot I didn't understand and had to do external reading about (biologically and chemically, especially for different types of bonding)! But in the end I think I've tackled this unit well. 

The 2 main analysis methods examined were: X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy (neither of these are imaging, they are methods of building consensus models). 

Other analysis methods are: homology models, electron diffraction, neutron diffraction and single molecule diffraction with X-ray lasers (atomic resolution is not trivial to implement).

It was also fun to read about certain algorithms overfitting the data creating less plausible models (perhaps ML advances may help address this in the future, such as the use of regularisers). I am excited to use ChimeraX for visualisations! I am especially excited to learn how to view stereo images.

== 3.10 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-ALI-Similarity Measuring Sequence Similarity] ==

</div>

; Activities
Went through the notes in great detail. Scoring matrices are used in sequence alignment to represent a variety of different models of similarity (identity, biophysical similarity, genetic code similarly, PAM or BLOSUM). Here my answers to the Q&A:

''Q: Compare an identical match of histidine with an identical match of serine. What does this mean?''

A: This means we have two sequences that we want to analyse and we have detected histidine in one area of the first sequence and serine in another area of the second sequence. We want to compare these matches for similarity to help us with sequence alignment. In this table we can see that histidine and serine have a similarity of -1.

''Q: How similar are lysine and leucine, as compared to leucine and isoleucine? Is this what you expect?''

A: Lysine and leucine have a similarity of -2 while leucine and isoleucine have a similarity of 2. This is indeed what I expected.

''Q: PAM matrices are sensitive to an interesting artefact. Since W and R can be interchanged with a single point mutation, the probability of observing W→R and R→W exchanges in closely related sequences is much higher than one would expect from the two amino acid's biophysical properties. Why?'' 

A: This is known as the extrapolation problem (as explained in Prof. Steipe's notes). This is because extrapolation to large PAM distances causes problems. If two amino acids have similar codons then mutating from one to the other is likely at the very close evolutionary distance of proteins in the Dayhoff dataset. Also, since evolution favours secondary mutation, introducing amino acids that are biophysically more compatible causes R->W to be unlikely in distantly related pars. However, in the Dayhoff model large evolutionary distances are extrapolated by repeatedly multiplying the matrix with itself so this discrepancy gets amplified and bring the result to almost identity. 

''Q: PAM matrices were compiled from hypothetical point exchanges and then extrapolated. Therefore these matrices assign a relatively high degree of similarity to (W, R), that is not warranted considering what actually happens in nature. Do you see this problem in the BLOSUM matrix? ''

A: No I do not. 

''Q: If BLOSUM does not have this issue, why not?''

A: BLOSUM does not have this issue since is compiles matrices directly from blocks of ungapped alignments of sequences at given evolutionary distances.

; Conclusion and Outlook
Different methods of similarity are absolutely critical for sequence alignment and I should always use BLOSUM unless otherwise specified! The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SYS-Concepts System models].

== 3.11 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SYS-Concepts System Models] ==

; Activities
Having already taken a formal course on signals and systems hopefully this course should not bee too challenging. 

Important definition: a system (with conceptual levels of bottom up, middle out and top down) is a collection of collaborating genes that have more significant relationships among each other than to genes that are not system members. 

Similarly to Prof. Steipe, I don't like UML conventions either. So here is my architectural diagram of a simple desk light:

[[File:DeskLight.jpg|600px|middle]]

; Conclusion and Outlook
Systems are a powerful abstraction of many fields of knowledge including bioinformatics. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-RegEx R RegEx].

; Conclusion and Outlook
This unit was useful to understand the high level abstractions of sequence analysis in bioinformatics. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-PPI-Physical_vs_genetic Physical vs Genetic Interactions].

== 3.15 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-PPI-Databases PPI Databases] ==

The main goal here is to learn where to find PPI databases and how to use them.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-10-27; date completed: 2018-10-27
</div>

; Activities
There are 283 interactions from 4 databases for MBP1. Most of the interactions come from the regulatory protein SWI6 which makes sense. Most of the interactions are genetic in nature (83%). 

; Conclusion and Outlook
This unit was very useful. Examining PPI databases will be invaluable to understand MYSPE better. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SEQA-Composition Sequence Composition].

== 3.16 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SEQA-Composition Sequence Composition] ==
; Objective
I want to investigate here how to analyse sequences using the first C of bioinformatics: Composition.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-10-27; date completed: 2018-10-27
</div>

; Activities
Using the EMBOSS explorer I ran MYSPE and Baker's Yeast MBP1 through. Indeed it is quite hard to compare for now since there is no expectation, overlay or formal techniques. Here is the data I exported:

[[File:pepinfo1(MYSPE).png|300px|middle]] [[File:Mbp1PepInfo1.png|300px|middle]] 

[[File:pepinfo2(MYSPE).png|300px|middle]] [[File:Mbp1PepInfo2.png|300px|middle]]

From the R tutorial I found out that MYSPE has an isoelectric point of 5.973908 and a molecular weight of 77054.5. The aggregate properties of MYSPE extracted using R can be seen as follows:

[[File:AProp(MYSPE).png|300px|middle]]

[[File:AProp2(MYSPE).png|300px|middle]]

Although this data is not fully interpretable as I do not have a perfect baseline I can infer a few characteristics. Indeed the three most enriched amino acids are histidine, aspartic acid and arginine. Similarly, the three most depleted amino acids are cysteine, phenylalanine and valine.

; Conclusion and Outlook
Wow. Sequence analysis by composition can go a long way in predicting the structure/role of a protein... The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SEQA-Comparison Sequence Comparison].

== 3.17 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SEQA-Comparison Sequence Comparison] ==

I want to investigate here how to analyse sequences using the second C of bioinformatics: Comparison.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-10-27; date completed: 2018-10-27
</div>

; Activities
I like the idea of the consensus sequence. There are strong parallels from this topic to topics in the machine learning realm that I am currently studying. Indeed, already being familiar with Markov models and Neural Networks was of good use for this unit.

When passing MYSPE and MBP1 on EMBOSS' pepcoil program I found out both MYSPE and MBP1 have coiled-coil sequences. MYSPE has 1 sequence with a probability of 1.0 while MBP1 has 2 sequences with probabilities of around 0.5 each (approximately comparable regions). 

Similarly when passing MYSPE through EMBOSS' tmap program, it correctly identified that there are no TM helices. In addition, tmap did find all ten TM-helices in Gef1.

; Conclusion and Outlook
Sequence Comparison is more complicated than the composition method but also provides significant insight. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SEQA-Collaboration Sequence Collaboration].

== 3.18 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SEQA-Collaboration Sequence Collaboration] ==

I did not find MYSPE in KEGG unfortunately. The full lineage is here: ''cellular organisms; Eukaryota; Opisthokonta; Fungi; Dikarya; Ascomycota; saccharomyceta; Pezizomycotina; leotiomyceta; sordariomyceta; Sordariomycetes; Hypocreomycetidae; Hypocreales; Cordycipitaceae; Cordyceps''.

COXPRESdb did not return any coexpressed genes. I believe this is because the database is not particularly complete for yeast genes...

; Conclusion and Outlook
I don't think KEGG is particularly well designed but this was a fun unit nonetheless. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-FUNC-Databases Molecular Function Databases].

I liked that SGD gives the option to save as a tab-delimited file because I can read those easily in R!

The STRING database is so amazing! It can do k-means clustering (an algorithm I've studied in ML classes) and a whole host of other really cool features! Look what it comes up with for MBP1 (I tried to make 2 levels readable but it is not an easy task):

Homology - diverged from a common ancester either after speciation (orthologous - close analogues in different species) or after duplication (paralogous - neofunctionalisation or subfunctionalisation). This is a commutative and transitative property.

I must say this unit troubled me. It obliterated my pre-existing belief that sequence alignment was mathematical and fairly straightforward. In fact, it presents alignment in its messy and imperfect true light. I wonder what solutions and algorithms currently exist for such major alignment issues!

; Conclusion and Outlook
A worrying and sad unit where the dreams of beautiful and perfect sequence alignment was shattered. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-ALI-Optimal_sequence_alignment Optimal Sequence Alignment].

== 3.24 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-ALI-Optimal_sequence_alignment Optimal Sequence Alignment] ==
; Objective
After the reality check of the previous unit, I am curious to see the optimal solutions for the various issues with sequence alignment. 

<div class="time-estimate">

Okay, so even if we can never be certain that we have the ''correct'' alignment we can still make fair assumptions. If the alignment of two sequences is such that their random similarity is highly unlikely, we can assume homology as the most probably reason. 

The optimal alignment is the closest we can ever get to the true alignment. Therefore if even the optimal alignment does not support homology then we can state confidently that the correct alignment does not support it either. 

So how to we do we do optimal sequence alignment?

Well not easily. For starters it having an NP-hard algorithm whose permutation space is more than the number of particles in the universe is not a good start. Enter: divide and conquer, recursion, momoization and a whole bunch of techniques to make this problem tractable.

Path matrices are an awesome way of showing alignments in a computationally efficient manner. As proved by the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, the optimal sequence is that which leads to the highest possible sum of all pair scores it contains. Have touched on dynamic programming before, I find this solution elegant and beautiful. 

Cargo cult warning here as aligning non-homologous sequences is meaningless. 

EMBOS was fun to use!

I also know how to do this in R which will be very useful in the future no doubt!

; Conclusion and Outlook
This was a very lengthy unit but absolutely fascinating stuff! I feel comfortable in sequence alignment science (and associated pseudoscience). The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-FUNC-GO Gene Ontology].

== 3.25 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-FUNC-GO Gene Ontology] ==
; Objective
The term ontology is still not crystal clear in my mind so my objective is to really understand what GO is and how GOA is undertaken and stored in databases. 

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 0.5 h; date started: 2018-11-03; date completed: 2018-11-03
</div>

; Activities
I think the main takeaway here is that GO is split into three categories: cellular components, molecular function and biologic components. All annotations in GO have GOA evidence codes to specify the explicit source of knowledge. This seems like a crazy web of knowledge. 

Having now visited amiGO and quickGO, the tree graphs and general organisation is truly admirable!

; Conclusion and Outlook
Wow GO seems like something that will become very powerful in subsequent units. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-FUNC-Semantic_similarity Semantic similarity].

== 3.26 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-FUNC-Semantic_similarity Semantic Similarity] ==
; Objective
How are genes similar? <- my objective is to be able to answer this question in considerable detail

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 0.5 h; date started: 2018-11-03; date completed: 2018-11-03
</div>

; Activities
I think the following definition is critical so I will note it down in my journal:

''Two genes are considered similar if the nodes they are annotated to are close in the gene ontology (GO). ''

I think the concept of information gain (or most informative common ancestor) and entropy cropping up here is interesting as it reminds me a lot of my decision tree classifiers in Machine Learning. 

It was amazing to run through the R script and see how well bioinformaticians have supported and documented R packages! Want to get the genetic similarity between genes (using optimal assignment)? Easy, just run <code>getGenSim("gene1", "gene2", similarity = "OA")</code> and voila! 

; Conclusion and Outlook
This was very informative and now I know how to compare similarity between genes in R! The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-ALI-BLAST BLAST].

== 3.27 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-ALI-BLAST BLAST] ==
; Objective
I've already seen BLAST databases in a previous learning unit so I have a rough idea how BLAST searches for homologues but I want to know the details!

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-11-04; date completed: 2018-11-04
</div>

; Activities
Homology algorithms having a complexity of O(n^2) means they are too slow for database-wide searches. 

Enter: Reciprocal Best-Match (RBM). RBM is defines orthologues by finding the best match in another specie's genome being identical it's own. 

BLAST (a non-global heuristic alternative to exact alignment) builds on this by adding extra enhancement and different implementations of RBM to find "High Scoring Pairs". 

Cargo-cult warning: high E-values do not mean that the hit is not a homologue, but small E-values do indicate that a pure-chance alignment is unlikely.

Hmm there seems to be a bug in the R-script... *types commands in the console furiously for 30min* ... aha! I found the source of my error! All fixed!

; Conclusion and Outlook
This unit took longer than expected as I was bug-hunting. However, at least now I understand what BLAST is (and more importantly what it is not). It is simply put a heuristic algorithm. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-Genome-Sequencing Genome Sequencing].

== 3.28 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-Genome-Sequencing Genome Sequencing] ==
; Objective
As I wanted to take a break from alignment and BLAST, I moved to this Genome Sequencing unit. My main objective here is to find out how my 23andme test (and other similar sequencing methods) were carried out! 

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-11-04; date completed: 2018-11-04
</div>

; Activities
The main methods of sequencing are (note that Mba/Gba is used here to represent the Megabase/Gigabase unit rather than Megabit/Gigabit): 

* First generation: traditional sequencing (2001 - 2 Mba/day, up to $6000 (400h 0m)/Mb)

* Second generation: parallel sequencing (2005 - 800+ Mba/day, depending on the technique $25 (1h 41m)-0.05/Mb)

* Third generation: single molecule sequencing (2014 - 10+ Gba/day, $0.01 (0h 1m)-0.05/Mb)

However, a much more complete list can be found on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing#Next-generation_methods the DNA sequencing Wikipedia page].

Prof. Steipe said, "the golden age of the desktop bioinformaticians may be coming to an end" for cross-genome comparisons but a silver lining is that our desktops get more and more powerful, our DNA complexity remains stable.

; Conclusion and Outlook
This unit was absolutely fascinating. My favourite so far! I am even considering buying my own full genome sequence in the future - rather than simply my partial genome that I purchased from 23andme! The earlier methods required a lot of preparation which is no longer needed today. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-Genome-Annotation Genome Annotation].

== 3.29 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-Genome-Annotation Genome Annotation] ==
; Objective
So I know how sequence annotation is done but what about full genome annotations? This is the question I want to be able to answer in this unit!

<div class="time-estimate">

; Activities
Well I could have guessed but the first step is to split the entire genome in subsequences and annotate the subsequences. 

Databases: ENCODE (human, mouse, worm & fly data), GOLD (info about current status of genome projects and their datasources). 

We must also find the genes for genome annotation. This can be achieved by four methods: analysis by signal (look for translation start sites, attachment sites and boundary signals), analysis by contents (look for characteristic trinucleotide patterns), analysis by homology (look for homologues in other species - most accurate if available) or interpretation of the transcriptome (look at RNASeq data). 

; Conclusion and Outlook
This was a short but informative unit. Thankfully full genome annotation does not seem too far fetched from previous annotation techniques seen in this course. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-ALI-PSI-BLAST PSI BLAST].

== 3.30 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-ALI-PSI-BLAST PSI BLAST] ==
; Objective
My objective here is to learn what the PSI BLAST algorithm improves on from the original BLAST, how it was designed and how to run it.

It seems the Position Specific Iterated (PSI) BLAST is a more sensitive version of BLAST that reduces neutral drift and works as follows:

   1. BLAST a query against protein DB

   2. Construct multiple sequence alignments from BLAST hits to create a Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM profile).

   3. Query the DB with the PSSM

   4. Estimate statistical significance (E-values) and propose significant hits for inclusion in next iteration.

   5. Go back to step 3 (usually 5 iterations). 

''Helpful advice: don't be overly vague or overly specific, use PSI-BLAST for weak but biologically meaningful relationships between proteins, irrelevant proteins can cause profile corruption (so filter if low complexity regions appear to cause specificity issues by introducing an E-value limit, visually inspect output after each iteration and remove suspicious hits by unchecking certain boxes) and false positive rate around 5%.''

On the other hand DELTA-BLAST builds a profile from CDD domains in the query and searches for this in the database. Other BLAST flavours include bl2seq and the PROCAIN server's improved BLAST. Finally we could also use EMBOSS for optimal alignments.

During the search I had some results with particularly low E-values for coverages above 80% so I omitted them. As recommended I noted them here:

The above log was useful until convergence after which I proceeded without logging. The results of my PSI-BLAST are as follows:

[[File:PSI-BLAST.png|middle|800px]]

; Conclusion and Outlook
This unit was very lengthy (waiting for PSI-BLAST and copying data into JSON files was a true test of patience) but worthwhile as I love to have this new skill of being able to PSI-BLAST smartly! The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-ALI-MSA Multiple Sequence Alignment].

== 3.31 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-ALI-MSA Multiple Sequence Alignment] (submitted: 6 marks) ==
; Objective
After all the units before, I am ready to tackle the MSA learning unit and I want to submit it. Again, the objective here is to hoover up as many marks as possible (and of course apply what I have learnt while learning about MSA). 

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 2 h; taken: 12 h; date started: 2018-11-04; date completed: 2018-11-05
</div>

; Activities
First things first, my submission page is available [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/students/index.php/User:Thomas_Hollis/Eval_MSA here].

Well this unit started off with a two disheartening facts: 

''1. Optimal pairwise alignments are less good than multiple sequence alignments!'' 

''2. Optimal multiple alignment is intractable for more than about 10 sequences!''

Objective functions here remind me of cost functions in machine learning... Are we going to minimise/maximise these with gradient descent/ascent? Sadly, no gradient surfing for today. MSA algorithms covered:

* Progressive alignment (e.g. Clustal W): fundamental but superseded with far better algorithms

* Consistency-based alignment (e.g. MUSCA & MEME): fundamental and incorporated into modern algorithms

* Probabilistic alignment (e.g. HMMER): fundamental

* Profile-based alignment (e.g. Gapped BLAST & PSI-BLAST): results can be displayed as an MSA

* Consistency-based progressive alignment (e.g. TCoffee): Prof. Steipe's favourite in terms of usefulness and usability

* General purpose (e.g. MUSCLE & MAFFT): very easy to use

The file formats covered are:

* Aligned FASTA

* CLUSTAL (not the same as the CLUSTAL algorithm)

* MSF (used by EMBOSS' EMAA)

Software examined was:

* JALVIEW (MSA editor)

Finally, the code developed for my submission is as follows:

Some important definitions I want to note in my journal:

* Monophyletic group: a clade (node and all its descendants).

* Paraphyletic group: a clade minus some of its members.

* Polyphyletic group: members of several clades, perhaps grouped by a convergence feature or other superficial similarity. 

* Cladogram: phylogenetic relationship graph showing only branching pattern, no meaningful branch length.

* Phylogram: most popular phylogenetic relationship graph showing branching where branch lengths indicate amount of genetic change.

* Ultrametric tree: cladograms but where branching point height is proportional to amount of time passed.

* Split network: phylogenetic relationship graph showing collections of splits.

* Horizontal gene transfer: transfer of genetic material other than by parent-offspring transmission (e.g. genetic engineering or gene-modifying viruses like those found in Chagas disease)

Great, I got the basics, now only 34'459'425 possible trees to explore! The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-PHYLO-Data_preparation Preparing Data for Phylogenetic Analysis].

; Activities
A few key facts I wish to note down in my journal before building phylogenetic trees:

0. (Optional) Assume a molecular clock

1. A good tree relies on a good MSA. Do it right.

2. Rows of sequences have to have the same number of characters and must hold aligned characters in the right columns.

3. Data must not include fragments of sequence which have evolved under a different evolutionary model.

4. Add an outgroup to root the tree (i.e. a last common ancestor).

; Conclusion and Outlook
Machine Learning methods are currently taking over human inspection for Phylogenetic Data Preparation techniques! It is however useful to know how to implement a quick and dirty approach in R. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-PHYLO-Tree_building Tree Building].

== 3.34 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-PHYLO-Tree_building Tree Building] ==
; Objective
Now that I know how to prepare the data, my objective is to learn how to build my first phylogenetic tree!

; Activities
Covered all the lectures notes and installed the software as required. Successfully built my first phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood from the 'proml' package! Very cool! Here it is in all it's glory:

[[File:PhyloTree1.png]]

; Conclusion and Outlook
A short and straight-to-the-point unit. It looks like MYSPE (ISAFU) is very close (in this tree) to SACCE (as expected) and NEUCR but far from ESCCO (which makes sense as this is the root). Further analysis here is needed and will be done in subsequent units. As the tree was successfully built, I am moving onto the next unit that I plan to take which is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-PHYLO-Tree_analysis Tree Analysis].

== 3.35 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-PHYLO-Tree_analysis Tree Analysis] ==
; Objective
Having finally built my phylogenetic tree my objective is to learn to analyse it and others!

; Activities
After going through the notes, I fixed an error with the learning unit and sent out the update to the mailing list (pending Prof. Steipe's approval). My fix is inspired from information on Biostars and is as follows:

<source lang="r">
if (!require(treeio, quietly=TRUE)) {
  if (! exists("biocLite")) {
    source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  }
  biocLite("treeio")
  library(treeio)
}

treeText <- readLines("phyliptree.phy")
treeText <- paste0(treeText, collapse="")
fungiTree <- read.tree(text = treeText)
distMat <- cophenetic(fungiTree)

fungiTree$tip.label <- apsTree2$ (0h 8m)tip.label #run this when the first error crops up at the end of the script
</source>

The learning unit says to follow the script, print a copy of the tree and bring it to class but the script no longer says to do this... So I decided to save some trees and print it here on the Wiki instead:

[[File:PhyloTree2.png|middle|500px]]

; Conclusion and Outlook
I hope Prof. Steipe accepts my hacky-fix but this made the unit more fun. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/ABC-INT-Phylogeny Phylogeny (Intergrator Unit)].

== 3.36 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-Genome-Browsers Genome Browsers] ==
; Objective
While waiting to finish my phylogeny integrator unit, let's move back to Genome Browsers for a while! I want to find which are the main online resources for this and how to use them.

</div>

; Activities
A short and sweet unit. So I took advantage of this to curate my own database of databases! Great stuff I am sure I will find useful in the future. I added the fantastic UCSC Genome Browser Project to the database. An easy choice to make (albeit maybe not as carefully considered as NAR compilations).

; Conclusion and Outlook
I know how to use the UCSC Genome Project - sweet. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-NCBI NCBI].

== 3.37 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-NCBI NCBI] ==
; Objective
More databases to look at with the main objective again of understanding what they contain and how to use them.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-11-06; date completed: 2018-11-06

; Activities
Went through the database instructions. Also did a major overhaul of the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/students/index.php/Entrez Entrez page]. 

* MYSPE refSeq ID: <code>XP_018701899</code>

* MYSPE UniProt ID: <code>A0A167PNW1</code>

; Conclusion and Outlook
The NCBI is vast, I still cannot believe the things I find on there. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-EBI EBI].

== 3.38 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-EBI EBI] ==

; Activities
Thoroughly went through the EBI website. Not much more to add here.

; Conclusion and Outlook
The EBI also seems vast but I don't seem to come across it as often (yet). The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-Data_integration Data Integration].

== 3.39 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-Data_integration Data Integration] ==

Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 0.5 h; date started: 2018-11-06; date completed: 2018-11-07
</div>

; Activities
Databases interface with... identifiers (a.k.a. IDs), cross references, federated databases (distinct DB, distributed query, merged result), programmable APIs (like in Entrez)! 

Here is a snipped of code that I wrote for this unit:

<source lang="r">
myMappedIDs[3,2] <- myIDs$name[match("NP_010038", myIDs$refID)]
myMappedIDs[3,1] <- "NP_010038"
myMappedIDs[4,2] <- myIDs$name[match("NP_013629", myIDs$refID)]
myMappedIDs[4,1] <- "NP_013629"
</source>

; Conclusion and Outlook
Having worked with APIs before this unit was not too surprising but was fun anyway. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Scripting_data_downloads Scripting Data Downloads].

== 3.40 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Scripting_data_downloads Scripting Data Downloads] ==
; Objective
Automation is often key. My goal is to figure out how to script and automate my data downloads! 

<div class="time-estimate">

; Activities
I had seen status codes before but I guess 200 was new to me since it always defaulted as OK. Interesting! 

The two minor functions that I wrote in this unit resemble those by Prof. Steipe so much that I have omitted them here. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
Scripting data downloads is a powerful tool not to be ignored. It is however worth noting that different websites are often best scraped in different ways so these data mining techniques need to be approached with a flexible mindset. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-EXPR-Analysis Expression Analysis].

== 3.41 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-EXPR-Analysis Expression Analysis] ==

; Activities
Thoroughly went through the short lecture notes. Interesting stuff. 

Thoroughly explored GEO2R. Differential expression is when a particular gene is expressed different amounts in two groups suggesting a certain condition could suppress the expression of a particular gene. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
This was somewhat confusing at first but a bit of wikipedia saved me. I can see why differentially expressed genes can be revelatory in bioinformatics. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-EXPR-Multiple_testing Multiple Testing].

I must say I really loved the light-hearted introduction which reveals the issue of multiple testing with a bar bet!

'''Task 1 - What are the data in each cell, column and row?'''

Here we are looking at the results from a series of experiments looking at the expression levels inside Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

<source lang="r">

> exprs(tmp)   # exprs() gives us the actual expression values.

* Each cell contains the expression value (i.e. how much a particular gene of a particular sample is expressed).

* Each column contains the sample name (representing one experiment) and all the expression levels associated with that sample in particular genes.

* Each row contains feature names (in this case genes) and all the expression levels associated with that gene across multiple experiments' sample.

'''Task 2 - What are these experiments?'''

These experiments are (in order):

* GSM81064 - Yeast cell cycle-time point 0 min 2001-05-03_0000.rfm
* GSM81065 - Yeast cell cycle-time point 10 min 2001-05-03_0010.rfm
* GSM81066 - Yeast cell cycle-time point 20 min 2001-05-03_0020.rfm
* GSM81067 - Yeast cell cycle-time point 30 min 2001-05-03_0030.rfm
* GSM81068 - Yeast cell cycle-time point 40 min 2001-04-11_0040.rfm
* GSM81069 - Yeast cell cycle-time point 50 min 2001-04-11_0050.rfm

In each experiment the yeast cell cycle microarray was used to identify global trancription profile. The full description is as follows: "Cells were synchronized with alpha factor and sampled every 10 min across 2 cell cycles. A total of 13 samples were analyzed. No replicates were included. cDNA of the cell cycle samples were labelled with Cy5. For Cy3 labelling, asynchronous yeast population was used."

'''Task 3 - Study this boxplot'''

[[File:TomBoxplot.png|middle|600px]]

* ''Q3.1: What's going on? Are these expression values?''

This box plot shows the distribution of gene expression values for the different samples detailed earlier. Box plots work by labelling the median in the middle, the inter-quartile range on either side of the median and the maximum and minimum quartiles. Each quartile contains 25% of the data points. This shows us how spread the data is and where it is concentrated. 

* ''Q3.2: What do the numbers that exprs() returns from the dataset mean?''

The <code> exprs() </code> command returns the expression measurements as well as error measurements (with controls) of the experiment data (as per the package description). We can confirm this by inspecting the function output. Indeed, we see expression levels for the genes as well as some levels for "blank", "empty" and various controls (like "E. coli control") which. 

'''Task 4 - Study this plot'''

[[File:TomGEO2RPlot.png|middle|600px]]

* ''Q4.1: What does it tell you? Is there systematic, global change in the values over time? Within a cycle? Over the course of the experiment?''

This line plot shows that the gene expression distribution is roughly Gaussian-distributed, centred about 0. Initially at T=0, around 3000 genes have expression levels very near 0. There is a systematic decrease in this number of genes near zero from T=0 to T=6 (inclusive). Then from T=9 to T=12 (inclusive) the gene expression values tend to go back to 0. 

I could infer from this that certain genes start being more expressed or suppressed between times of 30min and 60min in this experiment.

'''Task 5 - Row-wise Analysis: Expression Profiles'''

* ''Q5.1: Are all rows genes?''

No. As described earlier, not all rows are genes. Many rows contain "controls", some are "blank" and some are "empty". 

* ''Q5.2: What identifiers are being used?''

We are using the SGD Nuclear ORF systematic nomenclature convention and format here. Y stands for Yeast, A is the chromosome number (1), and the third letter is either "L" or "R" for the chromosome arm, as described in the [https://sites.google.com/view/yeastgenome-help/community-help/nomenclature-conventions SGD page].

* ''Q5.3: Are all rows/genes unique?''

Indeed all rows/genes are unique since <code> unique(rownames(ex)) == rownames(ex) </code> only returns <code> TRUE </code> values. 

* ''Q5.4: Are all yeast genes accounted for?''

As described in the code, we cannot know this yet as we have no information other than the gene identifiers, for now. (answers to come in future tasks no doubt...)

'''Task 6 - Read a table of features'''

Code developed:

<source lang="r">
# Thomas Hollis (BCH441, University of Toronto) -v2.3
# Purpose: Read a table of features

# ==   4.1  Task - Read a table of features  ===================================

# This data file is rather typical of datasets that you will encounter "in the
# wild". To proceed, you need to write code to read it into an R-object. Develop
# the code in your script file according to the following specification:
#
#    -  read "./data/SGD_features.tab" into a data frame
#          called "SGD_features"

SGD_original <- read.table(file = "./data/SGD_features.tab", quote = "", header = FALSE,
                           fill = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #for debugging

SGD_features <- read.table(file = "./data/SGD_features.tab", quote = "", header = FALSE,
                           fill = TRUE, sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#    -  remove unneeded columns - keep the following information:
#         -   Primary SGDID (1)
#         -   Feature type (2)
#         -   Feature qualifier (3)
#         -   Feature name - (the systematic name !) (4)
#         -   Standard gene name (5)
#         -   Description (16)

SGD_features <- SGD_features[,-(6:15)]

#    -  give the data frame meaningful column names:

colnames(SGD_features) <- c("SGDID", "type", "qual", "sysName", "name", "description")

#    -  remove all rows that don't have a systematic name. (You'll have to check
#          what's in cells that don't have a systematic name)

(nrow(SGD_features)) #16454

SGD_features <- SGD_features[!((SGD_features$sysName)==""), ]

(nrow(SGD_features)) #8061, checked visually - OK

#    -  check that the systematic names are unique (Hint: use the duplicated()
#          function.)

anyDuplicated(SGD_features$sysName) == "0" # returns TRUE - OK

#    -  assign the systematic names as row names

rownames(SGD_features) <- SGD_features$sysName

#    -  confirm: are all rows of the expression data set represented in
#                  the feature table? Hint: use setdiff() to print all that
#                  are not.
#                  Example:  A <- c("duck", "crow", "gull", "tern")
#                            B <- c("gull", "rook", "tern", "kite", "myna")
#                            setdiff(A, B)
#                            setdiff(B, A)

feature_names <- SGD_features$sysName
length(featureNames(GSE3635)) # 6228
length(feature_names) # 8061 - at least 1833 missing some that are missing in GSE3635
length(setdiff(feature_names, featureNames(GSE3635))) # 1907 missing

#       If some of the features in the expression set are not listed in the
#       systematic names, you have to be aware of that, when you try to get
#       more information on them. I presume they are missing because revisions
#       of the yeast genome after these experiments were done showed that these
#       genes did not actually exist.
#    -  confirm: how many / which genes in the feature table do not
#                have expression data?

# Answer: Since we saw above we had 1907 missing, thus 1907 genes in SGD_features table
# will not have corresponding expression data in GSE3635.
# All the names of the missing genes can be found by running:
# setdiff(feature_names, featureNames(GSE3635))

#  How should we handle rows/columns that are missing or not unique?

# Answer: Could simply drop them if they are not important. Else if they are
# we could pull the data from another database

Turn on gene plots can be found below. Indeed, from a pretty lengthy read of wikipedia I would expect turn on genes to have a cyclical pattern. I expect them to rise throughout the cycle and fall back again before the start of the next cycle (roughly 60min cycles here). This seems to be consistent with what most of the expression plots show (albeit Cdc14 and Cln3 seem to have a slightly delayed onset). The only gene that does not seem consistent with my expectations would be Cdc28 as it does not seem to be cyclical. Indeed this might be because it is both a turn on and a turn off gene (as will be discussed in the next section). I also hypothesise that Whi5 might have an odd point at T=60min which, if removed, might become inconsistent with my expectations. 

[[File:LU5Plot1.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot2.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot3.png|middle|250px]]

[[File:LU5Plot4.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot5.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot6.png|middle|250px]]

[[File:LU5Plot7.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot8.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot9.png|middle|250px]]

Turn off gene plots can be found below. Indeed, I would expect turn off genes to initially have a low expression (as they are suppressing) before returning to a higher expression. All these plots seem moderately consistent with this hypothesis except Cdc28 which seems to behave unexpectedly again. Once again, I hypothesise there that it is because it is both a turn on and a turn off gene that it has such unusual expression behaviour. 

[[File:LU5Plot10.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot11.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot12.png|middle|250px]]

[[File:LU5Plot13.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot14.png|middle|250px]] [[File:LU5Plot15.png|middle|250px]]

Housekeeping genes plots can be found below. Indeed, I have read that housekeeping genes are needed to maintain basic cellular function. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housekeeping_gene housekeeping gene wiki page] also explains that we can expect genes to be expressed at relatively constant rates (i.e. non-cyclical) in most non-pathological situation, even if this varies depending on experimental conditions. Therefore, I would expect them to be roughly expressed constantly in a non-cyclical manner throughout the cycle. This seems to be consistent with what their expression actually does as neither is cyclical (albeit alg9 has a slightly strange low start which increases expression throughout the cycle). This deviation is nonetheless consistent with literature as expression rates vary on experimental conditions, as seen in the wiki page.

'''Task 8 - Gene descriptions'''

Here is the code I developed: 

<source lang="r">
# Thomas Hollis (BCH441, University of Toronto) -v2.3
# Purpose: Print descriptions of differentially expressed genes

# ==   5.1  Final task: Gene descriptions  =====================================

#    Print the descriptions of the top ten differentially expressed genes.

top10 <- myTable[1:10,1]
for (g in top10) {
  cat("======================================= \n")
  des <- SGD_features$description[rownames(SGD_features) == g]
  if (length(des) != 0) {
    cat("Gene", g, "has description: \n", des, "\n")
  } else {
    cat("Gene", g, "has description: \n", des)
    cat("Error 404: No description found \n")
  }
}

# END

; Conclusion and Outlook
This was a really tough submission but I learnt a lot as I had to read so much information from Wikipedia! The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-FUNC-Domain_annotation Domain Annotation].

== 3.46 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-FUNC-Domain_annotation Domain Annotation] ==
; Objective
My objective here is to understand the complexities behind domain annotation.

</div>

; Activities
A domains are the natural unit of analysis of protein structure (used in separate folding, distinct function and modular inheritance). They allow:
* identification of folding regions
* identification of gene fusion or insertion (evolutionary history)
* understand protein mechanism (domain architecture)
* classification of proteins

Some information to note down can be found here:

* 1. From the section on "Confidently predicted domains ..."

The start and end coordinates of the KilA-N domain (...according to SMART, not Pfam, in case the two differ): start = 35, end = 118

All start and end coordinates of low complexity segments: start = 6, end = 14 & start = 131, end = 143

All start and end coordinates of ANK (Ankyrin) domains: start = 268, end = 297 & start = 390 & end = 419

Start and end coordinates of coiled coil domain(s) I expect only one: start = 515, end = 546

Start and end coordinates of AT hook domain(s) I expect some but not all not all Mbp1 orthologues have one: none here

*2. From the section on "Features NOT shown ..."

All start and end coordinates of low complexity segments for which the Reason is "overlap": none here

Any start and end coordinates of overlapping coiled coil segments: none here

*3. From the section on "Outlier homologues ..."

Start and end coordinates of a PDB:1SW6|B annotation (if you have one): start = 226, end = 434

[[File:SMARTtemp.png|middle|400px]]

Wow, after a lot of editing of the source code I finally got my plot to fit in my screen... I guess RStudio and 4k resolution are not good friends. Here it is in all its glory:

[[File:MBP1OrthologueDomainAnnotations.png|middle|600px]]

As for my interpretation of this... Well it is clear from the plot that all MBP1 orthologue domains share similarities in the KilA-N region which makes sense as this is the common ancestor. They also have some similarities in the APSES fold which again also makes sense. The other similarities do not quite line up but are still there. I assume more interpretation can be made here which is why I plan to come back to this after having completed further units.

; Conclusion and Outlook
Wow, domains are really powerful in helping sequence analysis in bioinformatics. Although inputting the data manually here was tedious. Specificity is an asset to avoid algorithms taking into account irrelevant data (this it turns out is true both for bioinformatics and a whole host of machine learning algorithms that I am studying at the moment). The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-FUNC-Annotation Function Annotation].

== 3.47 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-FUNC-Annotation Function Annotation] ==

My objective here is to recap all the units in this area.

; Activities
This unit seems empty. Since this unit is a recap unit anyway, I didn't expect much material. I was a bit mislead by the "do not work on this unit until it is live" but Wiki history saved me as it confirmed this unit has looked like this since September 2017 so I can safely skip past it!

; Conclusion and Outlook

== 3.48 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-SX-PDB PDB files] ==
; Objective
My objective here is to learn how to read PDB files and how to interpret their contents.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-11-18; date completed: 2018-11-18
</div>

; Activities
The first file has a resolution of 1.71 Angstroms. The the first residue in the SEQRES section "GLN" also the first residue with an ATOM record ("GLN" too). I think 66 water molecules of solvent were used while there are 248 in the structure. Remark 525 just lists two particular water molecules that are further than 5 Angstroms away.  

; Conclusion and Outlook
Honestly I struggled a lot with this unit because there was no introductory theory. It was straight into the PDB files with no biological context. I did learn loads of awesome new plotting techniques though! I might revisit this unit later once I have more perspective. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-SX-Chimera Chimera].

So I decided instead to go ahead and get lost in wikipedia!

; Conclusion and Outlook
Although this was not required, it was definitely worthwhile!

= 4. Statistics =
This section will be focussing on learning units that concern mathematical statistical theory and it implications in bioinformatics.

== 4.1 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-STA-Probability Probability] ==
; Objective
As a student in Machine Learning, the aim of this course is to refresh my knowledge on basic probability theory.

; Activities
I went through the R code thoroughly. There was actually a lot of very useful material that I had certainly forgotten or not previously considered (taken for granted). And as always I love all those colourful R graphs. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-STA-Significance Significance].

== 4.3 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-STA-Significance Significance] ==
; Objective
Since I did my bachelor thesis on granger causality relations of blockchain financial time series hopefully this chapter should be more of a consolidation than tackling new material. The main aim is to ensure I fully understand how to use and manipulate p-values.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-10-05; date completed: 2018-10-06
</div>

; Activities
I went through the R code thoroughly and read the recommended papers. The p value I got using <code> p = (Nobs + 1) / (N + 1) </code> was <code> 0.03297888 </code>. This suggests statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis (which in this case is that positively charged residues are not closer to negatively charged residues). The code also asks to mark down the sum of all the "chs" in binary hex format (I assume for Prof. Steipe to verify). Mine is: <code> 00 00 00 00 8c 9a e1 40 </code>.

The [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26961635 first paper] reviewed basically describes the tears of the American Statistical Association (ASA) which are concerned that papers only get published when p-values indicated statistical significance while papers showing no statistical significance do not get published. This yields a falsely robust methodology that the ASA are hoping to reverse.

The [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21878926 second paper] reviewed criticises neuroscience publications finding that around 50% of them use the incorrect procedure for evaluating statistical significance between two events, say A and B. The main error being that often A is shown to be statistically significant and control event B is said to be statistically significant but the difference between A and B is not examined to see if it itself is statistically significant. This paper also criticises the Cliff effect whereby people are overly swayed once the artificial boundary of $p < 0.05$ (0h 1m) is crossed. It however concludes than in many cases this lack of statistic rigour would not however change the conclusions of the papers.

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Genetic_code Genetic Code].

== 4.4 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-STA-Information_theory Information Theory] ==
; Objective
Since I am already quite familiar with information theory hopefully this should be a refresher.

; Activities
I really want to nail this integrator unit so I have set aside a large number of hours for it. I also made sure to wait until I explored a lot of the bioinformatics map to be as informed as possible before tackling this. The R code option tickles my fancy more than anything else so here goes: [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/students/index.php/User:Thomas_Hollis/Eval_Mutation_Impact evaluation page].

A lot of information about the cancer driving KRAS gene can be found [https://www.intogen.org/search?gene=KRAS on IntOGen]. The following graph from their website gives me a good idea of what a definite cancer driving gene mutation distribution looks like:

; Conclusion and Outlook
This was a great unit to help make sure I fully understand the previous unit on gene optimality. It seems we can conclude that PTPN11 does indeed play a role in cancer. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/BIN-PPI-Analysis PPI Analysis].

# 1. Introduction
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. I decided to write up my oral examination into an R notebook to engage in literate programming (as mentionned in a bonus learning unit that I took).

# 2. Code

## 2.1 Import required libraries

As always, lets import our required libraries and data before starting:

```{r eval=FALSE}
init()

if (! require(msa, quietly=TRUE)) {
  if (! exists("biocLite")) {
    source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  }
  biocLite("msa")
  library(msa)
}

if (! require(Biostrings, quietly=TRUE)) {
  if (! exists("biocLite")) {
    source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  }
  biocLite("Biostrings")
  library(Biostrings)
}

if (!require(Rphylip, quietly=TRUE)) {
  install.packages("Rphylip")
  library(Rphylip)
}

if (!require(phangorn, quietly=TRUE)) {
  install.packages("phangorn")
  library(phangorn)
}

source("makeProteinDB.R")
```

## 2.2 Data Preparation

### 2.2.1 Alignment

Let's first align some sequences (all sequences in the database + KILA_ESSCO for rooting the tree):

```{r eval=FALSE}
mySeq <- myDB$protein$sequence # add all DB sequences
names(mySeq) <- myDB$protein$name # add names of all DB sequences

mySeq <- c(mySeq,"IDGEIIHLRAKDGYINATSMCRTAGKLLSDYTRLKTTQEFFDELSRDMGIPISELIQSFKGGRPENQGTWVHPDIAINLAQ")
names(mySeq)[length(mySeq)] <- "KILA_ESCCO" # add KILLA_ESSCO sequence and name

(mySeqMSA <- msaClustalOmega(AAStringSet(mySeq))) # ClustalOmega used, too many seq for MUSCLE
```

### 2.2.2 Get the sequence of the SACCE APSES domain 

```{r eval=FALSE}
sel <- myDB$protein$name == "MBP1_SACCE" # selector for SACCE protein
proID <- myDB$protein$ID[sel] # store SACCE protein in proID for later

sel <- myDB$feature$ID[myDB$feature$name == "APSES fold"] # selector for APSES
fanID <- myDB$annotation$ID[myDB$annotation$proteinID == proID & myDB$annotation$featureID == sel] # SACCE & APSES
(start <- myDB$annotation$start[fanID]) # set start point (4)
(end   <- myDB$annotation$end[fanID]) # set the end point (102)

(SACCEapses <- substring(myDB$protein$sequence[proID], start, end)) #SACCE APSES seq
```

### 2.2.3 Extract the APSES domains from the MSA

It is worth noting that this includes PSI-BLAST results which can be found in MYSPE_APSES_PSI-BLAST.json. It addition, APSESmsa is of type "AAStringSet" not "MsaAAMultipleAlignment" as seen before. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
(APSESmsa <- fetchMSAmotif(mySeqMSA, SACCEapses)) # stored in .utilities.R, returns matching seq
```

### 2.2.4 Process the APSESmsa data for Tree Building

We need to mask some of the collumns. To do this we must first convert to a matrix of characters, then mask, then convert back and export to multi-FASTA.

```{r eval=FALSE}
(numAli <- length(names(APSESmsa))) # get the number of alignments (52)
(lenAli <- length(APSESmsa$MBP1_SACCE)) # get the length of the alignments (269)

msaMatrix <- matrix(nrow = numAli, ncol = lenAli) # initialize matrix to hold all chars
(rownames(msaMatrix) <- APSESmsa@ranges@NAMES) # assign the correct rownames
for (i in 1:numAli) {
  msaMatrix[i, ] <- unlist(strsplit(as.character(APSESmsa[i]), "")) # fill matrix
}
msaMatrix[1:7, 1:14] # check result is a well defined and formatted matrix

colMask <- logical(lenAli) # initialize a mask (logical vector to trim cols)
limit <- round(numAli * (2/3)) # define the 2/3 threshold for rejecting a column
for (i in 1:ncol(msaMatrix)) {  # iterate over all columns
  count <- sum(msaMatrix[ , i] == "-") # count hyphens in col
  colMask[i] <- count <= limit # write TRUE if less-or-equal to limit, FALSE if not
}
colMask # check mask makes sense
sum(colMask) # check how many collumns are kept (should be 101)
cat(sprintf("Masking %4.2f %% of columns.\n", 100*(1 - (sum(colMask)/length(colMask)) )))
maskedMatrix <- msaMatrix[ , colMask] # remove masked cols
ncol(maskedMatrix) # check how many cols left (should be 101)

tomAPSESphyloSet <- character() # initialise char object, namechange to avoid confusion
for (i in 1:nrow(maskedMatrix)) { # collapse back to string
  tomAPSESphyloSet[i] <- paste(maskedMatrix[i, ], collapse="")
}
names(tomAPSESphyloSet) <- rownames(maskedMatrix) # add names

writeALN(tomAPSESphyloSet) # inspect final result
writeMFA(tomAPSESphyloSet, myCon="tom_APSESphyloSet.mfa") # save aligned & masked to multi-FASTA
```

## 2.3 Build the tree using PROML

Import the clean, aligned & masked data. Use this to build the tree. (WARNING: took around 8h to run)

```{r eval=FALSE}
PROMLPATH <- "/Users/tom/Applications/phylip-3.695/exe/proml.app/Contents/MacOS" # set PROMLPATH
list.dirs(PROMLPATH) # confirm one directory is listed only
list.files(PROMLPATH) # confirm two files listed only "proml" and "proml.command"
apsIn <- read.protein("tom_APSESphyloSet.mfa") # import aligned & masked from multi-FASTA
myTree <- Rproml(apsIn, path=PROMLPATH) # run PROML to build tree (warning: 4-8h) start:6pm,end:?pm
plot(myTree) # have a quick look before further analysis
save(myTree, file = "tom_myTreeRproml.RData") # save locally to RData file
```

## 2.4 Analyse the tree

### 2.4.1 A few quick exploratory views of the tree

```{r eval=FALSE}
load(file = "tom_myTreeRproml.RData")
plot(myTree) # default type: "phylogram"
plot(myTree, type = "unrooted") # unrooted type
plot(myTree, type = "fan", no.margin = TRUE) # concentric circle type

str(myTree) # inspect the tree object
myTree$tip.label # inspect the tree object
myTree$edge # inspect the tree object
myTree$edge.length # inspect the tree object

plot(myTree) # plot the tree with labels
tiplabels(cex = 0.5, frame = "rect") # useful to find the outgroup (should be 17 here)
edgelabels(cex = 0.5) # add edge labels - looks messy, not very useful here
nodelabels(cex = 0.5, frame = "circle") # add node labels - looks messy, not very useful here

Nnode(myTree) # number of nodes (should be 50)
Nedge(myTree) # number of edges (should be 101)
Ntip(myTree) # number of tips (should be 52)

write.tree(myTree) # show the tree in console in Newick format
```

### 2.4.2 Rearrange the tree & root it with the outgroup

```{r eval=FALSE}
myTree <- root(myTree, outgroup = 17, resolve.root = TRUE) # change this for outgroup number
plot(myTree) # check it out
is.rooted(myTree) # make sure the tree is now rooted

myTree$edge.length[1] <- 0.1 # rescale the tree to a reasonable size
plot(myTree, cex = 0.7) # check it out

myTree$root.edge <- mean(myTree$edge.length) * 1.5 # make the root visable
plot(myTree, cex = 0.7, root.edge = TRUE) # check it out
```

### 2.4.3 Rotate the clades 

This is useful to better compare with cladogram of species.

```{r eval=FALSE}
nodelabels(cex = 0.5, frame = "circle") # add node labels - looks messy, not very useful here (except for rotations)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 100)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 54)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 60)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 61)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 62)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 77)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 74)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 69)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 70)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 71)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 98)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 96)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 95)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 81)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 64)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 58)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 80)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 84)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 93)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 88)
myTree <- rotate(myTree, node = 99) # beautify
plot(myTree, cex = 0.7, root.edge = TRUE)
```

### 2.4.4 Computing Tree Distance with reference tree

This is bonus tree analysis and was omitted here as it is not included in instructions.

; Activities
You can access the page [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/students/index.php/User:Thomas_Hollis/Eval_Cancer_kNN here].

Please see the version history to see all the development that has gone on in building this unit from v0.1 (stub) to the latest version!

I am so proud of this unit. I designed it in the same style as prof. Steipe's units so that it could easily be added to future courses without too many changes. I absolutely loved creating it and I really hope some student stumbles across it some day (I must confess I spend a bit too many hours on this unit and I got really carried away...)

; Conclusion and Outlook
This really was great fun. I hope my learning unit is taken by someone in the future! I am even considering having a wiki structure for any course that I may end up teaching if my career heads toward education.
