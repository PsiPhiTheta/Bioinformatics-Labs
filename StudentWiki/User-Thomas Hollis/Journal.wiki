This section outlines the work done on all the courses that have to do with course preparation. 

== 0.1 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Wiki_editing Wiki Editing] ==
; Objective
The main objective is to gain an in depth understanding of how to navigate and edit the student wiki as well as comprehend what will be expected of me throughout the course. 

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 2 h; taken: 6 h; date started: 2018-09-14; date completed: 2018-09-15
</div>

; Activities
I accessed and created my main StudentWiki user page, journal page and insights page.  This was not too challenging as I have been contributing to Wikipedia's public body of information for a few years now and I am used to the WikiMarkup syntax. As an avid fan of the open-source community, I also created and committed my current progress to my own personal [https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta "Bioinformatics" Github repository] for the rest of the world to use. What was the most time consuming was to explore the entire wiki to see everything that this course has to offer, including all the activities that occurred in previous years. I must confess I did get a little carried away in my exploration and the boundary between "fun" and "work" is already starting to blur. However, I do believe that this is a good sign and I am very excited for the course ahead.

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Journal Journal Writing].

== 0.2 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Journal Journal Writing] ==
; Objective
The main objective is to start off my Journal with a strong baseline on which I can build the rest of my discoveries in this course.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 1.5 h; date started: 2018-09-15; date completed: 2018-09-15
</div>

; Activities
I started writing my journal, including this precise section. I also edited my main [[User:Thomas_Hollis | user page]] and added some information to help my classmates identify who I am and what my background is. This will undoubtably be useful for collaboration in the future, especially given my computer science background with very little biology knowledge. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/ABC-Plagiarism Plagiarism].

== 0.3 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/ABC-Plagiarism Plagiarism] ==
; Objective
The main objective is to revise concepts related to Plagiarism. Collaboration can all to easily turn into plagiarism in academic institutions and the only way to stamp it out is through education.

Read the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Netiquette Netiquette] page carefully and came up with an insight for future me.

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Backups Backups].

== 0.6 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Backups Backups] ==
; Objective
The main objective is to refresh existing knowledge on how to securely backup data to prevent accidental data loss. 
<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 0.5 h; date started: 2018-09-16; date completed: 2018-09-16
</div>

; Activities
Read the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Backups Backups] page carefully and verified the effectiveness of my current backup solution. I currently store all of my personal files (excluding application data) in iCloud drive, which is continually backed up on Apple servers. So when is the last time I made a backup? Approximately three seconds ago when I saved my most recent file. Apple servers themselves are geographically distributed, redundant and backed up (often using RAID or similar technology). In addition, as I do not trust anyone else but myself with my own data, I also make differential local backups of my entire drive on the 1st of each month. This is done on two separate external hard drives (Time Machine really is a good utility). This allows me to have an on-site backup and off-site backup which protects me in the case that there is a fire and both my laptop and my hard drive get destroyed. Indeed the risk of this is non-negligeable as there are 24 000 house fires per year in Canada <ref>SGI Canada. (2018). Fire prevention and safety. Retrieved September 16, 2018, from https://www.sgicanada.ca/news?title=fire-prevention-and-safety</ref> for a total of 14 million houses <ref>Statistics Canada. (2016). Canada 2016 Census. Retrieved September 16, 2018, from https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/as-sa/98-200-x/2016005/98-200-x2016005-eng.cfm</ref>. The probability of fire is therefore around 0.17% per year, roughly the same as the SSD failure rate listed in the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Backups Backups] page. 

As a quick sanity check I created and deleted a test file (containing the data: "ATGC") that I successfully recovered, as shown aside. [[File:RecoveredFile.png|200px|thumb|right|Recovered data from deleted test file]]

; Conclusion and Outlook
While friends may laugh at my backup strategy and fail to understand why I get so excited on the first day of each month, I will persist in backing up my data reliably. The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Cargo_Cult Cargo Cult].

== 0.7 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Cargo_Cult Cargo Cult] ==

; Activities
After reading the entire recommended setup, I made a total of 0 changes to my setup. Indeed, I already had installed all the recommended tools, already structured my filesystem well and of course all my file extensions are always displayed by default. Yay! 

I very much like that Prof. Steipe is on my side in the macOS vs. Windows war... take that [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates Bill]. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Installation Installation].

= 1. R Programming =
This section outlines the work done on all the courses related to learning the R programming language. 

== 1.1 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Installation Installation] ==
; Objective
The main objectives are to remind myself on how to install and run packages in R. 

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 0.5 h; date started: 2018-09-16; date completed: 2018-09-16
</div>

; Activities
Indeed as I have had prior experience using R and RStudio this module was more of a refresher. Nonetheless, I found it to be a useful review - especially the script that checks if a package is already installed before installing it. I also executed all the code suggested and had a good play around with the new packages discussed. 

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Setup Setup].

== 1.2 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Setup Setup] ==
; Objective
The main objectives are to check that my R environment is setup as recommended for bioinformatics.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 0.5 h; taken: 1 h; date started: 2018-09-16; date completed: 2018-09-16
</div>

; Activities
Indeed as I have used RStudio in the past only for machine learning and statistics, it was not optimally configured for Bioinformatics so I slightly tweaked my setup. I also learnt all about connecting RStudio to GitHub and did all the suggested exercises.

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Console Console].

== 1.3 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Console Console] ==

; Conclusion and Outlook
The next unit that I plan to take is [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Help Help].

== 1.4 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Help Help] ==

</div>

; Activities
Running all the suggested code was a good opportunity for me to check that I am building my knowledge on good foundations. I was also able to make sure I don't have any bad R-programming habits to shake off. One particular thing I brushed up on was the difference between the "<-" and "=" in R. A really good explanation was read [https://renkun.me/2014/01/28/difference-between-assignment-operators-in-r/ here]. I also found out in this week's lecture that you never need to explicitly define parameters that have the "=" sign in R documentation.

I ran through the code and spend a significant amount of time getting lost in rabbit wholes about how R ''actually'' does things... (see more on this in my [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/students/index.php/User:Thomas_Hollis/insights!#Insight_.236_-_Why_you_should_never_trust_someone_who_says_.22Trust_Me.22 insights!] page).

; Activities
This unit was actually very interesting as it went over in detail an aspect of R that I had always overlooked: the detail of lists. I learn lots of new R tricks! 
<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:800px">
Here is the script I wrote:

== 1.9 [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/RPR-Subsetting Subsetting] ==
; Objective
The main goal for me here is to learn the details of subsetting in R which I may not already be aware of.

<div class="time-estimate">
Time estimated: 1 h; taken: 2 h; date started: 2018-09-19; date completed: 2018-09-19
</div>

; Activities
I was surprised to learn a lot of new things about subsetting when completing all the required exercises.  For example, it was interesting to find out the difference between <code>order(x)</code> and <code>sort.list(x)</code> simply by reading R documentation! I absolutely love how organised the R documentation is - makes coding in R extremely smooth! Lots of new things covered here. I must make sure to try to practice what I have learnt soon to help engrain it into long term memory.
