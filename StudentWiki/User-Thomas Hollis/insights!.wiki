= Top 25 Shortlist =
For sake of concision, the following constitutes my top 25 bioinformatics insights by chronological order (effort was made to create rhymes but alas Shakespeare's wit is a challenge mere bioinformaticians can only strive toward). 

== Insight #1 - Standing On The Shoulders of Giants ==
 
In 1675, Isaac Newton is famously quoted to have said: "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants." <ref>Newton, I. Letter from Sir Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke. Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Retrieved 16 September 2018.</ref>. In a similar vein, my first few days spent on this course made me realise the following insight that I have phrased into a poem:

''''' The future will always be better than the past '''''

''''' From the shoulders of bigger, better and more numerous giants '''''

''''' We may now use new tools to learn increasingly fast '''''

''''' Allowing us to visit more science and become its ultimate clients '''''

== Insight #2 - You Know What a Good Insight Is? ==
You know what a good insight is? Rhetorical questions. After having read "What do you think I think of that? Exactly." on the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Netiquette Netiquette page], I had not only a wholesome chuckle but also an insight. As an aspiring educator, the following advice will undoubtably be useful to future-me:
; Never allow technology to make your educational delivery boring. The age-old tip of engaging with your audience is just as valid for online content!

== Insight #3 - Always Follow the Breadcrumbs ==
Sometimes I wonder if I follow too many breadcrumbs. Today, I was not disappointed when I followed the URL to [https://github.com/hyginn Prof. Steipe's GitHub]. The profile picture being a QR code was too enigmatic for me to ignore. Like a child on an easter egg hunt, I scanned it and spent the next hour getting lost in Wikipedia's various pages on the art of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bosch Hieronymus Bosch].

''''' Always follow the breadcrumbs '''''

''''' As it may lead to fascinating outcomes '''''

''''' You never know what you might stumble across '''''

''''' Just make sure that you minimise time loss '''''

== Insight #4 - Never Forget the Big Picture ==
[[File:Progress.png|200px|thumb|right|A screenshot of my current progress]]
I have always believed that maintaining a high level view of the situation helps to motivate me to work in an efficient and targeted manner. It always me to know what I am doing and to know where I want to get to. 
; Therefore, I have decided to gradually check off each unit once I have finished going through it in a graphical high level way.

== Insight #5 - Bluelight Is Your Sleep Cycle's Worst Enemy ==
I have known for many years now that blue light (light closer to the UV side of the EM spectrum) was particularly good at suppressing the secretion of melatonin. I have however always assumed that, if I was ''really'' tired, my lack of melatonin would not be an issue. However, after much late night coding on a monitor with fullscreen RStudio I find myself in disagreement with my past-self. 
; RStudio has a night mode that can be activated in the global settings!

== Insight #6 - Why You Should Never Trust Someone Who Says "Trust Me" ==
When Prof. Steipe says (without justification) that I should take the habit of always setting <code>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code>, my eyebrows raised immediately. This made me think of people who make a statement or recommendation and when prompted to explain the rationale behind this, their reply is: "Trust me". I have found that, in most cases, "trust me" usually means "I have an idea why but I don't want to explain it to you". In many cases this is indicative of a weak idea where the supporting data is missing (e.g. "Trust me, X is a bad politician"). However, in other cases this is indicative of a highly knowledgeable person whose time is limited (e.g. "Trust me, that won't work"). I believe that in both cases the investigation is entirely worth it! If someone has a poor argument, take the most charitable interpretation of the argument and try to find data for or against it. In the case where someone doesn't have time to explain it to you, don't take their word for it - look it up yourself! You'll never know what kind of secrets could spill out. In this case the secrets behind <code>stringsAsFactors = FALSE</code> were [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_factors.htm definitely worth it].
; Never trust someone who says "Trust me".

== Insight #7 - Keep a (Dream) Journal ==
I woke up in the middle of the night with an absolutely fantastic idea of something to write in my insights page. I had been visualising it in my dreams and I finally came up with something cool. Unfortunately when I woke up the next morning I had forgotten all about the idea. On the other hand this in itself provided me with an insight

''''' Always keep a (dream) journal '''''

''''' For your memory is not eternal '''''

''''' Sleep or time can seize your thoughts to format or wipe '''''

''''' Keeping journals is not merely for Prof. Steipe '''''

== Insight #8 - The N-Sided Dice Question ==
In lectures a few days ago, Prof. Steipe mentioned his dilemma of creating a physical fair ''n''-sided dice for any ''n'' such that the dice has an axis of symmetry. I didn't think about this again for a while until my shower this morning where I asked myself what the most aesthetic solution would be. By the time I had dried myself off I would like to put forward my solution: 
; My solution is an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosohedron n-gonal regular hosohedron] but with each vertex thickened to prevent excessive rolling (think of an under-inflated beach ball with stiff sticks between each colour).

== Insight #25 - Reflect on How Far You Have Come ==
[[File:ProgressFinal.png|200px|thumb|right|A screenshot of my final progress]]
As hindsight is settling in, it seems to me that looking back at the course map and seeing visually how much I have achieved is hugely beneficial.  
; Therefore, I have decided to repost Insight #4 but updated showing the overall achievement.

= Honorable Mentions = 
Upon rereading my insights, I have found another insight: many of my insights use language such as "never, "always" or "worst". This is bound to come back to bite me as I am sure I can find exceptions to all of these rules. Perhaps my final insight should have been: 
; The only strong opinion anyone is entitled to is the strong opinion that nobody is entitled to strong opinions.
