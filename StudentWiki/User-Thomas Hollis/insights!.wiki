= Top 25 shortlist =
For sake of concision, the following constitutes my top 25 bioinformatics insights by chronological order (effort was made to create rhymes but alas Shakespeare's wit is a challenge mere bioinformaticians can only strive toward). 

== Insight #1 - Standing On The Shoulders of Giants ==
 
In 1675, Isaac Newton is famously quoted to have said: "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants." <ref>Newton, I. Letter from Sir Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke. Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Retrieved 16 September 2018.</ref>. In a similar vein, my first few days spent on this course made me realise the following insight that I have phrased into a poem:
; The future will always be better than the past
; From the shoulders of bigger, better and more numerous giants
; We may now use new tools to learn increasingly fast
; Allowing us to visit more science and become its ultimate clients

== Insight #2 - You know what a good insight is? ==
You know what a good insight is? Rhetorical questions. After having read "What do you think I think of that? Exactly." on the [http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/index.php/FND-Netiquette Netiquette page], I had not only a wholesome chuckle but also an insight. As an aspiring educator, the following advice will undoubtably be useful to future-me:
; Never allow technology to make your educational delivery boring. The age-old tip of engaging with your audience is just as valid for online content!

== Insight #3 - Always follow the breadcrumbs ==
Sometimes I wonder if I follow too many breadcrumbs. Today, I was not disappointed when I followed the URL to [https://github.com/hyginn Prof. Steipe's GitHub]. The profile picture being a QR code was too enigmatic for me to ignore. Like a child on an easter egg hunt, I scanned it and spent the next hour getting lost in Wikipedia's various pages on the art of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieronymus_Bosch Hieronymus Bosch].
; Always follow the breadcrumbs
; As it may lead to fascinating outcomes
; You never know what you might stumble across
; Just make sure that you minimise time loss

== Insight #4 - Never forget the big picture ==
[[File:Progress.png|200px|thumb|right|A screenshot of my current progress]]
I have always believed that maintaining a high level view of the situation helps to motivate me to work in an efficient and targeted manner. It always me to know what I am doing and to know where I want to get to. 
; Therefore, I have decided to gradually check off each unit once I have finished going through it in a graphical high level way. 
; (see screenshot of progress aside)

== Insight #25 - Reflect on how far you have come ==
[[File:ProgressFinal.png|200px|thumb|right|A screenshot of my final progress]]
As hindsight is settling in, it seems to me that looking back at the course map and seeing visually how much I have achieved is hugely beneficial.  
; Therefore, I have decided to repost Insight #4 but updated showing the overall achievement.
