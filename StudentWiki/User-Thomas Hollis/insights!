= Top 25 shortlist =
For sake of concision, the following constitutes my top 25 bioinformatics insights by chronological order (effort was made to create rhymes but alas Shakespeare's wit is a challenge mere bioinformaticians can only strive toward). 

== Insight #1 - Standing On The Shoulders of Giants ==
 
In 1675, Isaac Newton is famously quoted to have said: "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants." <ref>Newton, I. Letter from Sir Isaac Newton to Robert Hooke. Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Retrieved 16 September 2018.</ref>. In a similar vein, my first few days spent on this course made me realise the following insight that I have phrased into a poem:
; The future will always be better than the past
; From the shoulders of bigger, better and more numerous giants
; We may now use new tools to learn increasingly fast
; Allowing us to visit more science and become its ultimate clients
