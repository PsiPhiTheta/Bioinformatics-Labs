= Useful code =
Below is a collection of useful code snippets for subsequent reuse and referral. I hope that future-me finds them useful, as well as hopefully other classmates.

== Git cheat sheet ==
This is a cheat sheet for Git syntax that I wrote to help myself and classmates remember any git command for the future.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Command example
! Operation explanation
|-
| <source lang="R"> git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY </source>
| Clones the linked repository to local storage
|-
| <source lang="R">git add GenomeAlgo.py
git commit -m "v10.5"

git push origin master </source>
| Pushes the updated file to the master branch with the version as a comment
|-
|} 

== R cheat sheet ==
This is a cheat sheet for R syntax that I wrote for myself and my classmates to avoid silly mistakes and learn the R language more thoroughly.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Command example
! Operation explanation
|-
| <source lang="R">library(RWeka)</source>
| Installs the RWeka package and all its dependencies
|-
| <source lang="R">save(x, y, z, file = “mydata.RData”)</source>
| Saves objects x, y, z regardless of whether they are vectors, factors, lists or data frames into a file of given name.
|-
| <source lang="R">load(“mydata.RData”)</source>
| Recreates the x, y, z data structures
|-
| <source lang="R">save.image()</source>
| Saves current session to a file called .RData (R will look for this file automatically next time you start R)
|-
| <source lang="R">CTRL+L</source>
| Clears terminal
|-
| <source lang="R">mydata <- read.csv("data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = FALSE)</source>
| By default R assumes that CSV files include headers as the first row of the file thus header = FALSE must be used for headless CSV files.
|-
| <source lang="R">write.csv(pt_data, file = "pt_data.csv")</source>
| Used to create a CSV file from an R object
|-
| <source lang="R">object_name</source>
| Prints the information stored in an R object
|-
| <source lang="R">remove(object_name)</source>
| Removes an R object
|-
| <source lang="R">CVector_name <- c(“John”)</source>
| Writes a character vector
|-
| <source lang="R">NVector_name <- c(9.81)</source>
| Writes a numeric vector
|-
| <source lang="R">IVector_name <- c(12, 13)</source>
| Writes an integer vector (two entries)
|-
| <source lang="R">LVector_name <- c(TRUE, FALSE)</source>
| Writes a logical vector (two entries)
|-
| <source lang="R">NULL</source>
| Special vector type used in machine learning used to indicate absence of a value
|-
| <source lang="R">NA</source>
| Special vector type used in machine learning used to indicate missing value (used for uninitialized values in vectors)
|-
| <source lang="R">& | ! </source>
| AND, OR, NOT logical operators
|-
| <source lang="R">%>%</source>
| Pipe operator
|-
| <source lang="R">Vector_name[1:4]</source>
| Prints elements of vector from 1st to 4th in the form:   [1] 12, 13, NA, NA
|-
| <source lang="R">blood <- factor(c("O", "AB", "A"), levels = c("A", "B", "AB", "O"))</source>
| Creating a factor with 3 blood types and adding a level that did not appear in the data before writing to the var ‘blood’ in the form:
[1] O  AB A 
Levels: A B AB O
|-
| <source lang="R">list()</source>
| List function which creates a list, a fast way of assigning/displaying data of an object
|-
| <source lang="R">m <- matrix(c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd'), nrow = 2)</source>
| Matrix creation results in the following:
"a"  "c" 
"b"  "d"
|-
| <source lang="R">summary(patients$year)</source>
| Useful for investigating numeric variables (displays several common summary statistics). 
|-
| <source lang="R">mean()</source>
| Function used to find the mean of data
|-
| <source lang="R">median()</source>
| Function used to find the median of data
|-
| <source lang="R">range()</source>
| Returns minimum and maximum values of data
|-
| <source lang="R">IQR()</source>
| Used to find the inter-quartile range of data
|-
| <source lang="R">var()</source>
| Outputs the variance of dataset
|-
| <source lang="R">sd()</source>
| Outputs the standard deviation of dataset
|-
| <source lang="R">plot(x = patiens$age, y = patients$diseases,
main = "Scatterplot of Age vs. Concurrent Diseases",
xlab = "Patient age (years)",
ylab = "Number of concurrent diseases")</source>
| Typical scatterplot command
|-
