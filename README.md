Coursework and laboratory files for the UofT Bioinformatics course

## 1. Student Wiki

All my bioinformatics work is documented in the [Journal Wiki](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Bioinformatics-Labs/blob/master/StudentWiki/User-Thomas%20Hollis/Journal.wiki) Subpage of my main [Student Wiki](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Bioinformatics-Labs/blob/master/StudentWiki/User:Thomas%20Hollis.wiki) page. The evaluation units are added as seperate Wiki Subpages in the [Eval](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Bioinformatics-Labs/tree/master/StudentWiki/User-Thomas%20Hollis/Evals) folder. There is also an [Insights!](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Bioinformatics-Labs/blob/master/StudentWiki/User-Thomas%20Hollis/insights!.wiki) subpage for the main realisations aquired throughout the course. Note that certain resources are private and will not be displayed (UofT restriction). 

## 2. Scripts

Some of the scripts written are saved explicitely as seperate scripts in the [scripts](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Bioinformatics-Labs/tree/master/scripts) folder, while a lot of the other R programming is embedded in the [Journal Wiki](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Bioinformatics-Labs/blob/master/StudentWiki/User-Thomas%20Hollis/Journal.wiki).
