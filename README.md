# Bioinformatics-Labs
Coursework and laboratory files for the UofT Bioinformatics course

## 1. Student Wiki

All my bioinformatics work is documented in the Journal wiki of my student wiki page. The evaluation units are added as seperate wiki pages. There is also an insights page for the main realisations aquired throughout the course. 

## 2. Scripts

Some of the scripts written as saved explicitely as seperate scripts, while a lot of the other R programming is embedded in the wiki pages.
