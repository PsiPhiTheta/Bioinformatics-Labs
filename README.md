Coursework and laboratory files for the UofT Bioinformatics course

## 1. Student Wiki

All my bioinformatics work is documented in the Journal Wiki Subpage of my main Student Wiki page. The evaluation units are added as seperate Wiki Subpages. There is also an "Insights!" subpage for the main realisations aquired throughout the course. 

## 2. Scripts

Some of the scripts written are saved explicitely as seperate scripts in the "scripts" folder, while a lot of the other R programming is embedded in the [Journal Wiki](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Bioinformatics-Labs/blob/master/StudentWiki/User-Thomas%20Hollis/Journal.wiki).
